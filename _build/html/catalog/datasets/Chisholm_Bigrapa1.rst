Prochlorococcus ecotype qPCR counts for the BiG RAPA cruise
###########################################################



Paul Berube collected and extracted samples,  Allison Coe performed qPCR assay.
PI: Sallie W. Chisholm, MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering

**Sampling**:  Samples for qPCR were collected and preserved as described  (Zinser et al., 2006). Seawater was collected in a triple seawater rinsed HDPE bottle. 100 mL of seawater was filtered onto 25 mm diameter, 0.2 um pore size, polycarbonate filters (in triplicate) and chased with 3 mL of preservation solution (10 mM Tris pH=8, 100 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl).  Filters were placed dry inside 2 mL screw cap polypropylene bead beater tubes and stored at -80oC until use.

**DNA Extraction**:  DNA from field samples was extracted from filters as previously described (Zinser et al., 2006). Cells were resuspended by adding 650 ul of 10 mM Tris pH=8 to the bead beater tube containing the filter and bead beated at maximum speed (~4800 rpm) for 2 minutes. 500 ul of the respuspended cells were transfered to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and the cells were heat lysed at 95oC for 15 min. DNA samples were then stored at -80oC until analysis.

**Ecotype quantitative PCR**:  The qPCR assay was performed as previously described (Ahlgren et al., 2006; Zinser et al., 2006; Malmstrom et al., 2010; Malmstrom et al., 2013) using the same standards and reaction conditions. Technical duplicates of three replicate filters were analyzed for BiG RAPA (i.e. 6 data points per sample). Data quality was assessed using the percent coefficient of variation for the 6 data points. When cell concentrations fell below the detection limit of the assay (indicated by the associated quality flag), cell concentrations were set to the theoretical detection limit of 0.65 cells/mL.
